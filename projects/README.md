# Decision services files

The archives in this repository contain sample decision services. You can import these samples directly into Decision Designer, which points directly to this directory (see [Importing and exporting decision services](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYHZ8_21.0.x/com.ibm.dba.aid/topics/con_import_export.html)).

The Training sample contains five decision services that introduce you to the main concepts of Automation Decision Services: business rules, data management, decision diagrams, decision tables, and interaction policies. The sample includes a series of decision models that gradually increase in complexity.
