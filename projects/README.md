# Decision services files

The archives in this repository contain sample decision services. You can import these samples directly into Decision Designer, which points directly to this directory (see [Importing and exporting decision services](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/21.0.3?topic=decisions-importing-exporting-decision-services)).

The Training sample contains several decision services that introduce you to the main concepts of Automation Decision Services: business rules, data management, decision diagrams, decision tables, interaction policies and task models. The sample includes a series of decision models that gradually increase in complexity.
